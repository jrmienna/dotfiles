Heavily inspired by WebStorm's code highlight and inspection.\n\n![A screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/18avdoZ.gif)\n\n### Current Features\n* Proper scope inspection\n* Global variables detection\n* Shows variable definition\n* Shows properties, class methods and literals usages\n* ES6 support\n* JSX support\n* Light theme support (see Settings)\n\n### Future Plans\n* Support for `this`\n* Mark assignments with special CSS class\n\n### Issues\nCurrently code is parsed in strict mode, meaning that if there's an error in the code, it won't be parsed and highlighted. I'm not convinced that parsing needs to be done in \"loose\" mode and would advise to use [eslint](https://atom.io/packages/linter-eslint) instead to spot and fix errors.\n\nPlease report any issues.\n\n### Contributions\nPull requests are welcome!\n\n### License\nMIT\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/heilhead/es-identifier-highlight/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/heilhead/es-identifier-highlight#readme","_id":"es-identifier-highlight@0.2.6","_shasum":"4f6b022cb13bdee551bc66976cb23d591707d9cd","_resolved":"file:../d-115823-3166-buo0go/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115823-3166-buo0go/package.tgz"}
