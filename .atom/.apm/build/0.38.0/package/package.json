Custom by [specifying your own build command](#custom-build-command)\n    * Supports multiple targets.\n    * Supports error matching.\n  1. [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org) (runs `npm install`) - if `package.json` exists where `engines['node']` is set\n  1. [Atom](http://atom.io) (runs `apm install`) - if `package.json` exists where `engines['atom']` is set\n  1. [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) - if `Gruntfile.js` exists\n    * Supports multiple targets.\n  1. [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) - if `gulpfile.js` exists\n    * Supports multiple targets.\n  1. [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) - if `Makefile` exists\n  1. [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) - if `mix.exs` exists\n  1. [Cargo](http://doc.crates.io) - if `Cargo.toml` exists\n    * Supports error matching.\n\nIf multiple viable build options are found, `atom-build` will\nprioritise according to the list above. For instance, if `package.json` and\n`Gruntfile.js` are both available in the root folder, `npm install` will be\nexecuted by `atom-build`.\n\nIf you need to run `grunt`, `gulp` or other tool to build your project, then you can utilize the [postinstall-script](https://www.npmjs.org/doc/misc/npm-scripts.html) of package.json. This will also help you if grunt is run as a node module since it\nwill be downloaded (via `npm install`) prior.\n\n<a name=\"custom-build-command\"></a>\n## Specifying a custom build command\n\nIf the built-in defaults are not enough to suit your needs, you can specify\nexactly what to execute. Create a file named `.atom-build.json` in your project root:\n\n    {\n      \"cmd\": \"<command to execute>\",\n      \"name\": \"<name of target>\",\n      \"args\": [ \"<argument1>\", \"<argument2>\", ... ],\n      \"sh\": true,\n      \"cwd\": \"<current working directory for `cmd`>\",\n      \"env\": {\n        \"VARIABLE1\": \"VALUE1\",\n        \"VARIABLE2\": \"VALUE2\",\n        ...\n      },\n      \"errorMatch\": \"^regexp$\",\n      \"targets\": {\n        \"<name of target>\": {\n          \"cmd\": \"<command to execute>\",\n          ... (all previous options are viable here except `targets`)\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\nNote that if `sh` is false `cmd` must only be the executable - no arguments here. If the\nexecutable is not in your path, either fully qualify it or specify the path\nin you environment (e.g. by setting the `PATH` var appropriately on UNIX-like\nsystems).\n\n<a name=\"custom-build-config\"></a>\n### Configuration options\n\n  * `cmd` - **[required]** The executable command\n  * `name` - **[optional]** The name of the targets. Viewed in the targets list (toggled by `build:select-active-target`).\n  * `args` - **[optional]** An array of arguments for the command\n  * `sh` - **[optional]** If `true`, the combined command and arguments will be passed to `/bin/sh`. Default `true`.\n  * `cwd` - **[optional]** The working directory for the command. E.g. what `.` resolves to.\n  * `env` - **[optional]** An array of environment variables and their values to set\n  * `errorMatch` - **[optional]** A regular expression to match output to a file, row and col. See [Error matching](#error-match) for details.\n  * `targets`- **[optional]** Additional targets which can be used to build variations of your project.\n\n### Replacements\n\nThe following parameters will be replaced in `cmd`, any entry in `args`, `cwd` and\nvalues of `env`. They should all be enclosed in curly brackets `{}`\n\n  * `{FILE_ACTIVE}` - Full path to the currently active file in Atom. E.g. `/home/noseglid/github/atom-build/lib/build.js`\n  * `{FILE_ACTIVE_PATH}` - Full path to the folder where the currently active file is. E.g. `/home/noseglid/github/atom-build/lib`\n  * `{FILE_ACTIVE_NAME}` - Full name and extension of active file. E.g., `build.js`\n  * `{FILE_ACTIVE_NAME_BASE}` - Name of active file WITHOUT extension. E.g., `build`\n  * `{PROJECT_PATH}` - Full path to the root of the project. This is normally the path Atom has as root. E.g `/home/noseglid/github/atom-build`\n  * `{REPO_BRANCH_SHORT}` - Short name of the current active branch (if project is backed by git). E.g `master` or `v0.9.1`.\n\n<a name=\"error-match\"></a>\n## Error matching\n\nError matching let's you specify a regular expression which captures\nthe output of your build command and opens the correct file, row and column of\nthe error. For instance:\n\n```bash\na.c:4:26: error: expected ';' after expression\n  printf(\"hello world\\n\")\n                         ^\n                         ;\n1 error generated.\n```\n\nWould be matched with the regular expression: `^(?<file>[^\\\\.]+.c):(?<line>\\\\d+):(?<col>\\\\d+)`.\nAfter the build has failed, pressing `cmd-alt-g` (OS X) or `ctrl-alt-g` (Linux/Windows), `a.c` would be\nopened and the cursor would be placed at row 4, column 26.\n\nNote the syntax for match groups. This is from the [XRegExp](http://xregexp.com/) package\nand has the syntax for named groups: `(?<name> RE )` where `name` would be the name of the group\nmatched by the regular expression `RE`.\n\nThe following named groups can be matched from the output:\n  * `file` - **[required]** the file to open. May be relative `cwd` or absolute. `(?<file> RE)`.\n  * `line` - **[optional]** the line the error resides on. `(?<line> RE)`.\n  * `col` - **[optional]** the column the error resides on. `(?<col> RE)`.\n\nSince the regular expression is written in a JSON file, backslashes must be escaped.\n\nThe `file` should be relative the `cwd` specified. If no `cwd` has been specified, then\nthe `file` should be relative the project root (e.g. the top most directory shown in the\nAtom Editor).\n\nIf your build outputs multiple errors, all will be matched. Press `cmd-alt-g` (OS X) or `ctrl-alt-g` (Linux/Windows)\nto cycle through the errors (in the order they appear, first on stderr then on stdout).\n\nOften, the first error is the most interesting since other errors tend to be secondary faults caused by that first one.\nTo jump to the first error you can use `cmd-alt-h` (OS X) or `ctrl-alt-h` (Linux/Windows) at any point to go to the first error.\n\n## Analytics\n\nThe `atom-build` package uses google analytics to keep track of which features are in use\nand at what frequency. This gives the maintainers a sense of what parts of the\npackage is most important and what parts can be removed.\n\nThe data is fully anonymous and can not be tracked back to you in any way.\nThis is what is collected\n\n  * Version of package used.\n  * Build triggered, succeeded or failed.\n  * Which build tool was used.\n  * Visibility of UI components.\n\nIf you really do not want to share this information, you can opt out by disabling\nthe [metrics package](https://atom.io/packages/metrics). This will disable all analytics\ncollection, including the one from `atom-build`.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/noseglid/atom-build/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/noseglid/atom-build","_id":"build@0.38.0","_shasum":"bfc9b241363efae35de80ce1318c6efc02b4135c","_resolved":"file:../d-115520-70948-1pq65k7/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115520-70948-1pq65k7/package.tgz"}
